Some files, especially video and audio, can get quite large.  To resolve this, computer scientists have come up with ways of encoding the data that makes the information smaller.  This is known as compression.

Some compression works only when a file is not in use.  Zipping a folder or several files is and example of this.  When the file is zipped, it cannot be read or accessed.

Other data is compressed to save space but is still able to be read by applications.  

Sometimes data is lost or thrown away because it is not necessary.  This helps to save space.  For example an audio file might not need the frequencies that humans can't hear.  An image can become more pixelated if the intent is to show it from a greater distance.  There is a maximum picture quality the human eye can see.

If data can be compressed without losing any information it is called "Lossless"
If data is lost in the compression process it is called "Lossy".
