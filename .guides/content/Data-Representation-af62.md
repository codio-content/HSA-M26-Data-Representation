All data is represented as 0s and 1s at the most basic level of computing.  That aside, different types of data (picture, audio, video, text) are encoded differently so they can be opened by their appropriate applications.  For example, when you open an image file in Notepad, you get symbols that make no sense.  

This different type of encoding allows computers to store all the data as binary bits but then read the data as anything an application can interpret.  There are even variations between similar types of data.  Images can be stored as .png, .jpg,.png, or .gif files or many other file types.  The type tells your computer which application can open the file and the application uses the type to know the format in which a file was encoded so it can decode it for you.
