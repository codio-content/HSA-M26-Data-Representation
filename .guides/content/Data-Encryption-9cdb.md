Just as a text editor cannot open a video file, the way a file is encoded affects who can see the contents and how.  Sometimes, this is used to keep secret files from being read by people without permission.  When a file is purposely encoded to hide the data it is called encryption.   

When a file is encrypted, the bits are changed in a way that can not be easily reversed.  The software used to encrypt may use a password, fingerprint, or other means to verify a user before it will decrypt the data.

Encoding is different than encryption.  The purpose of encryption is to hide the message from all who don't have the key.  Encoding is changing the values to a standardized format.  For example, letters can be encoded into ASCII which is a system where each letter or character can be represented by 8 bits which is also known as a byte.  Encoding is also used in compression and converting files from one type to another.
